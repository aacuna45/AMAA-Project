# TaskMaster
TaskMaster is a desktop productivity application that can help the user keep track of their day-to-day activites and reminders. 
It can help keep the user stay productive by giving motivational quotes and keeping a to-do list! <br>

# Functionality
TaskMaster allows the user to create new reminders, delete reminders, and show the user different quotes! The program also allows the user to export their reminders to a .csv file, if ever needed.

# Downloading and Installing
In order for TaskMaster to run, the user must first install JavaFX SDK on their system. It is assumed that the user has done this and added needed envirionment variables to PATH correctly.
After the installation of JavaFX, you may open this file in any code editior, however we recommend using VSCode. Once the file has been opened, please go to the `setting.json` file and update the directory to the correct directory where you have installed JavaFX. Example: <br>

"c:\\Path\\To\\JavaFX\\javafx-sdk-17.0.6\\lib\\*.jar"
